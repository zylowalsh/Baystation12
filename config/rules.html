<head><title>Server Rules</title></head>
<body>Welcome to the Hyperion Station 13 server.  We have our own custom rules but we use the Baystation 12’s Space Law.  If you have any questions about anything in game, feel free to “adminhelp” us.  We are more than happy to help.<br>
<br>
For reference, the Space Law book is an in-game item and can be found in many locations around the station.  You may ask any head of staff or anyone in the security department.  It is also located at the following link:<br>

<br>
Below are the rules for Hyperion Station 13: <br>
<ol>
    <li>We are here to have fun interacting with each other.  Take into account that your actions have effect on other people in real life.  This includes being civil in OOC chat or having non-offensive ckeys or character names.</li>
    <li>Keep IC information out of OOC chat and OOC information out of IC chat.</li>
    IC in OOC is:
    <ul>
        <li>Identifying who the antagonist are or asking about a game mechanic that is related to an antagonist role</li>
        <li>Saying you are dead when it is not common knowledge or when not in the process of being revived</li>
        <li>Using OOC as a radio when the radio is not functioning</li>
    </ul>    
    <li>Do not meta-game.</li>
    Meta-gaming is:
    <ul>
        <li>Using flaws in the game to gain information about the current round that would not be available to your character</li>
        <li>Using information about the current round from OOC, adminhelp or from being a ghost</li>
        <li>Using non-game means to communicate information about the current round amongst players</li>
        <li>Holding grudges against characters that have played antagonist</li>
        <li>Having advanced knowledge about jobs which are outside your department</li>
    </ul>
    Meta-gaming is not:
    <ul>
        <li>Recognizing characters from previous round(s)</li>
        <li>Having knowledge of first aid or basic construction</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Do not grief.  Playing as an insane character is no excuse for grieving under any situation.</li>
    Grieving is defined below:   
    <ul>
        <li>Attempting to kill someone or trying to permanently remove him or her from the game without escalation or being an antagonist.  Being yelled at is not escalation and is no reason to kill someone.</li>
        <li>Intentionally releasing the singularity when not being an antagonist</li>
        <li>Maliciously using bombs to damage the station when not being an antagonist</li>
        <li>Turning someone into a monkey without their consent or when not being an antagonist</li>
        <li>Turning the telecommunications off when not being an antagonist
        <li>Any action that could potentially end the round or have the escape shuttle called</li>
    </ul>
    <li>All positions have responsibilities and expectations.  If you do not do your job, it is possible that you will get job banned.  We understand that people have to do the job in order to get better at the job but we expect you to learn from your mistakes.</li>
    <li>Hate speech or hate crimes of any kind are not tolerated.</li>
    <li>Erotic role-playing is tolerated but it needs to be between consenting adults and done in a private section of the station.</li>
    <li>Do not admit to grieving or intentionally breaking rules on other Space Station 13 servers.  All servers have different rules and styles of play but are affected by the community as a whole. 
    <li>Be civil and specific when using “adminhelp.”  An admin is there to help people and run the game.  In addition, an admin might be playing in the game along with handling several admin issues.  Insulting or spamming an admin is a quick way to be banned.  Take into account that each admin is a volunteer and spends several hours each day making sure everyone is having fun.</li>
    <li>Do not ask to be admin.  When we look for an admin, we check the players that have been on the server the most and that follow the rules.  However, this is not a comprehensive set of criteria for our selection process.</li>
	<li>Each admin may disregard any of these rules at their discretion when they feel it is in the best interest of the current round/server/player base at large.  They will be fully accountable for their actions should they choose to exercise this privilege.</li>
</ol>
The way we play the game is not everyone's cup of tea.  We understand that and we do not fault you if you enjoy more a competitive style of play but we do expect you to go elsewhere for that.<br>
<br>
This is not a comprehensive list.  If you think an action is wrong then it is probably wrong.  Use “adminhelp” or do not do it.<br>
